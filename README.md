Predicting investment grade default rates with linear regression
default and transition ates are essential to pricing or risk management. Based on a forecast for next year's default rate , for example, one can set appropriate loan rates for short-term loans. due to some candidate variables we may have a good reason to believe that the following year should be either relatively good or bad year for credits. if the economy is moving into a recession one should expect default rates to be relatively high.
